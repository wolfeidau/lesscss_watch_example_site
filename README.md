This is a basic site demonstrating use of [LessCSS](http://lesscss.org) in a simple static site.

It is based on [HTML5boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/ "HTML5 Boilerplate Website")

Once you grab a copy of the site navigate to the base directory and run the following command.

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then open <localhost:8000#!watch> in your browser.

Open and start hacking css/style.less then scroll down to the section marked "Your styles !" and start hacking.
